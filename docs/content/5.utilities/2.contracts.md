# Contracts

Here is a list of contracts utilities.

## awaitContractDeployed()

Utility function to wait for a contract to be deployed. It checks the contract deployment status every `interval` milliseconds.

### Parameters

- **checkDeployment**: A function that checks the contract deployment status.
- **maxAttempts**: Maximum number of checks. If the contract is not deployed after `maxAttempts`, an error is thrown.
- **interval**: Interval between checks in milliseconds.

## useOpenedContract()

Contains an opened contract instance whenever it is possible.

### Parameters

- **contract**: A contract or a ref to a contract to open.

### Returns

A `ComputedRef` to the opened contract. May be `null` if the contract is not available yet or if `TonClient` is not initialized yet.

### See Also

- `OpenedContract`
- `TonClient`

### Example

```typescript
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import { useOpenedContract } from '@d0rich/vueton'
import { MyContract } from 'path/to/contracts'

const contract = ref<MyContract | null>(null)
const openedContract = useOpenedContract(contract)

contract.value.getCrucialData()
```

## useContractAsync()

Waits for a contract to be opened. Might be useful with `useOpenedContract`.

### Parameters

- **contract**: A ref to a contract.

### Returns

An opened contract object unwrapped from the ref.
