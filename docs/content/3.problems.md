# Possible problems

There is a list of problems you can face and which do not depend on the library itself.

## Buffer polyfill

`@ton/core` uses Node buffer implementation, so in order to use it in the browser, you need to use a polyfill like [`vite-plugin-node-polyfills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-node-polyfills).

## `@ton/ton` object parser

[`@ton/ton`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/ton) client can not process accept complex responses from the endpoints. This problem is addressed here: https://github.com/ton-org/ton/pull/45 .

## Endpoints errors

[`@orbs-network/ton-access`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbs-network/ton-access) might reject some requests if you DApp sends too many requests in a short period of time. That's why `axios-retry` is used to retry the requests. However, [`@ton/ton`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/ton) does not provide an access to the axios instance to configure retries. The problem is addressed here: https://github.com/ton-org/ton/pull/73 .

::alert{type="info"}

  The two last mentioned problems can be fixed by applying [this patch](https://github.com/d0rich/vueton/blob/main/patches/%40ton%2Bton%2B15.1.0.patch) to [`@ton/ton`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/ton). Vueton can work with and without this patch.
